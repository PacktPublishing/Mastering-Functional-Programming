This is the code repository for [Mastering Functional Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-functional-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788620796 ), published by Packt.

**Learn how functional programming can help you in deploying web servers and working with databases in a declarative and pure way **

## What is this book about?
In large projects, it can get difficult keeping track of all the interdependencies of the code base and how its state changes at runtime. Functional Programming helps us solve these problems. It is a paradigm specifically designed to deal with the complexity of software development. This book will show you how the right abstractions can reduce complexity and make your code easy to read and understand.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Write reliable and scalable software based on solid foundations 
Explore the cutting edge of computer science research 
Effectively solve complex architectural problems in a robust way 
Avoid unwanted outcomes such as errors or delays and focus on business logic 
Write parallel programs in a functional style using the actor model 
Use functional data structures and collections in your day-to-day work

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public void drink() {
  System.out.println("You have drunk a can of soda.");
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are from an imperative and OOP background, this book will guide you through the world of functional programming, irrespective of which programming language you use.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
